      "explanation": "Horizontal scaling (also called scaling out) means adding more instances of the same type to distribute the load, such as adding additional EC2 instances.

      ],
      "explanation": "Reliability in AWS refers to the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service failures and dynamically acquire resources to meet demand. Automatically provisioning new resources (B) ensures workloads can scale reliably, and the ability to recover quickly from failures (E) is a core reliability principle. Least privilege (A) is a security practice, global services (C) relate to global reach, and compensation (D) is a business policy, not a reliability feature.",

        "A"
      ],
      "explanation": "Responsibilities in the AWS Shared Responsibility Model vary depending on the service model being used (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS). AWS is responsible for the security 'of' the cloud (physical infrastructure, hardware, and foundational services), while the customer is responsible for security 'in' the cloud (guest OS, application-level controls, data). Options B, C and D are incorrect because they assert blanket responsibilities that don't apply to all service types.",

      ],
      "correctAnswers": [
        "B"
      ],
      "explanation": "When you use consolidated billing (AWS Organizations), Reserved Instance (RI) pricing benefits are shared across linked accounts so that all accounts can receive the hourly cost benefit of the Reserved Instances. The discounts are not limited to the master account. Reserved Instances do not change instance performance, and consolidated billing does provide cost benefits beyond informational purposes.",

      "correctAnswers": [
        "C"
      ],
      "explanation": "To achieve the highest level of availability you should deploy across multiple Regions and Availability Zones. Regions provide geographic isolation (protecting against regional failures), and Availability Zones protect against AZ-level failures. Deploying to Edge locations is for CDN/latency optimization, while VPCs/subnets are networking constructs and do not by themselves provide cross-region resilience.",

      ],
      "explanation": "To reduce latency for US users while minimizing costs, deploy new EC2 instances in a Region located in the US. This brings compute closer to users and reduces round-trip time.
